When importing unit fbx with animation, do:
1. check selected objects
2. Make sure that the object is in a normal/neutral state, not in the middle of some pose. 
3. select only "Armature, Mesh" object types
4. Leave Apply Scalings at "All Local". (change to "FBX Units Scale" if sizing isn't working after import)
5. set forward to "-Y forward"
6. check Apply Transform
7. open "Armature" category, uncheck "Add Leaf Bones"
8. open "Bake Animation" category (uncheck this if importing without animation), uncheck "All Actions" if importing a lot of animations (make sure that they are selected in the Nonlinear Animation area). If just a few actions (<= 3),  uncheck "NLA Strips" and "Key All Bones". 

(note: I'm not sure if it's possible to add new animations to currently existing models. Seems you must make a new model, then make an avatar from the new model and give that avatar to all the models that use its animations)

If adding a separate armature from the main skeleton armature on a unit, you need to create a new armature as a separate object, and then match it with the chosen mesh separately. Then join the armature with the main skeleton armature (Ctrl + J), then join its respective mesh with the main skeleton armature mesh. (if that doesn't work, maybe set up the animation while the armatures are separate?). Make sure the bones all have unique names before merging. Also make sure to return origin to 3d poing by being in object mode, select the object, going to "Object", and "Set Origin". 

If unit is sinking into the ground, I think the fbx needs to be imported again.
